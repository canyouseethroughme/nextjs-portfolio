## Personal Portfolio — built with Next.js (App Router)

Welcome! 👋
This is my personal portfolio built using Next.js with the App Router. 
Feel free to explore the code, run it locally, or use it as inspiration for your own projects.

### Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies `yarn`
- Create `.env` file in the project root
- Log in to Hygraph, copy the High Performance Content API endpoint (this is only for me, as you don't have access to it), and add it to the `.env` file `NEXT_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=endpoint_here`
- Start the local development server `yarn dev`
